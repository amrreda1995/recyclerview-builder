## What's new in v2.0.0

### - Now, no need to specify the the generic data type as ViewItemRepresentable in AbstractViewItem abstract or its sub abstract classes (ViewItem or even BindingViewItem)

* Note that, you have to remove the ViewItemRepresentable generic data type from all your previous ViewItems starting from version 2.0.0
* See the updated documentation
